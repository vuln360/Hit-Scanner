# Hit Scanner
"I decided to develop a scanner named Hit-Scanner in Python to identify vulnerabilities. The purpose is to address vulnerabilities, not harm others. Previously, I created Vuln360 to categorize vulnerabilities, and now I aim to design a scanner for discovering more vulnerabilities. All efforts are for a safer future. I welcome your suggestions."
